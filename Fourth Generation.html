<p>The invention of the microprocessors brought along the fourth generation of computers. The years 1971-1980 were dominated by fourth generation computers. C, C++ and Java were the programming languages utilized in this generation of computers. For instance, the STAR 1000, PDP 11, CRAY-1, CRAY-X-MP, and Apple II. This was when we started producing computers for home use.</p>
<br><p>The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of 
integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. 
What in the first generation filled an entire room could 
now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, 
developed in 1971, located all the components of the 
computer - from the central processing unit and 
memory to input/output controls - on a single chip. 
In 1981, IBM introduced its first computer for the home 
user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh. 
Microprocessors also moved into many areas of life as more 
and more everyday products began to use microprocessors. 
As these small computers became more powerful, they could 
be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to 
the development of the Internet. Fourth generation computers 
also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld 
devices. </p></br>
