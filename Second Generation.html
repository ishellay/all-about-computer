<p>The years 1957-1963 were referred to as the “second generation of computers” at the time. In second-generation computers, COBOL and FORTRAN are employed as assembly languages and programming languages. Here they advanced from vacuum tubes to transistors. This made the computers smaller, faster and more energy-efficient. And they advanced from binary to assembly languages. For instance, IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600ee, and so forth.</p>

<br><p>Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. 
The transistor was invented in 1947 
but did not see widespread use in 
computers until the late 50s. The 
transistor was far superior to the 
vacuum tube, allowing computers to 
become smaller, faster, cheaper, more 
energy-efficient and more reliable 
than their first-generation 
predecessors. Though the transistor 
still generated a great deal of heat 
that subjected the computer to 
damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tubes. Second-generation 
computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output. Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary 
machine language to symbolic, or assembly, languages, 
which allowed programmers to specify instructions in 
words. High-level programming languages were also 
being developed at this time, such as early versions of 
COBOL and FORTRAN. These were also the first 
computers that stored their instructions in their memory, 
which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core 
technology. </p></br>
