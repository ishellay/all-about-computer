  <p>This period, from 1940 to 1955, saw the development of machine language for computers.  These computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory.  They were complex, large, and expensive machines, mostly relying on batch operating systems and punch cards for input.  Magnetic tape and paper tape served as input and output devices. A large first-generation computer vacuum tubes and magnetic drums for memory. These computers were expensive and occupied entire rooms."Examples include ENIAC, UNIVAC-1, and EDVAC.</p>

     <br><p>The first generation of computers relied on machine language instructions and used vacuum tubes in their construction. The machines themselves were huge and required extensive cooling mechanisms to keep them from overheating. The first generation of computers was not considered programmable as the instructions that could be carried out by the machines were all pre-programmed into them at the time of manufacture. This meant that the instructions built into the machine had to be changed after construction to carry out new tasks.

A brief history of the first generation of computers, including how they were developed and the technologies they used.
