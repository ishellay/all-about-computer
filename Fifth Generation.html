<p>These computers have been utilized since 1980 and continue to be used now. This is the present and the future of the computer world. The defining aspect of this generation is artificial intelligence. The use of parallel processing and superconductors are making this a reality and provide a lot of scope for the future.Â Fifth-generation computers use ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology. These are the most recent and sophisticated computers. C, C++, Java,.Net, and more programming languages are used. For instance, IBM, Pentium, Desktop, Laptop, Notebook, Ultrabook, and so on.</p>
 <br><p>Fifth generation computing devices, based on 
artificial intelligence, are still in development, 
though there are some applications, such as 
voice recognition, that are being used today. 
The use of parallel processing and 
superconductors is helping to make artificial 
intelligence a reality. Quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years 
to come. The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond to 
natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization. </p></br>
